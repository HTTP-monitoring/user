## Introduction
Well, well, well, I have the same project in my repository named HTTP_monitoring which does exactly the same thing, <br/>
that project started to become larger and larger which was really hard to maintain that was when my friend and teacher<br/>
[Parham Alvani](https://github.com/1995parham) suggested to change the project to smaller microservices that were much<br/>
easier to maintain, here is how I want to break the project to smaller projects
